Hi there!

I'm passionate about new tech & computing. After working as a Geologist, I decided to change my career towards programming, which made me start my adventure in this world studying the Web Development Bootcamp with Ironhack, and itÂ´s without a doubt where I want to orientate my career. In my github you can find the main 3 projects i developed while working in this bootcamp and more little labs and tests where you can see how I work and keep learning!
